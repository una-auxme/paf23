## Adding packages with pip

To have a unified setup every python package has to be added with a fixed version.

> Please don't install a package (inside a container) with `pip install xxx` since it would then be just installed in your specific container.

Instead, any package should be added to `code/requirements.txt`. Always set the package to a fixed version with `==` to avoid version conflicts.

An example how this file could look like is given below:

```text
torch==1.13.0
torchvision==0.1.9
```
