## Readability and Maintainability

- **Consistent Formatting:** Code should follow a consistent and readable formatting style. Tools like linters or formatters can help enforce a consistent code style.
  - [linting](./linting.md)
  - [coding_style](./coding_style.md)
- **Meaningful Names:** Variable and function names should be descriptive and convey the purpose of the code.
- **Comments:** Clear and concise comments should be used where necessary to explain complex logic or provide context.

## Code Structure

- **Modularity:** Code should be organized into modular components or functions, promoting reusability and maintainability.
- **Appropriate Use of Functions/Methods:** Functions should have a clear purpose and adhere to the single responsibility principle.
- **Hierarchy and Nesting:** Avoid overly nested structures; use appropriate levels of indentation to enhance readability.

## Efficiency and Performance

- **Optimized Algorithms:** Code should use efficient algorithms and data structures to achieve good performance.
- **Avoidance of Code Smells:** Detect and eliminate code smells such as duplicated code, unnecessary complexity, or anti-patterns.

## Error Handling

- **Effective Error Messages:** Error messages should be clear and provide useful information for debugging.
- **Graceful Error Handling:** Code should handle errors gracefully, avoiding crashes and providing appropriate feedback.

## Testing

- **Comprehensive Test Coverage:** Code should be accompanied by a suite of tests that cover different scenarios, ensuring reliability and maintainability.
- **Test Readability:** Tests should be clear and easy to understand, serving as documentation for the codebase.

## Security

- **Input Validation:** Code should validate and sanitize inputs.

## Documentation

- **Code Comments:** In addition to in-code comments, consider external documentation for the overall project structure, APIs, and configurations.
- **README Files:** Include a well-written README file that provides an overview of the project, installation instructions, and usage examples.

## Version Control

- **Commit Messages:** Use descriptive and meaningful commit messages to track changes effectively.
  - [commit](./commit.md)
- **Branching Strategy:** Follow a consistent and well-defined branching strategy to manage code changes.

## Scalability

- **Avoid Hardcoding:** Parameterize values that might change, making it easier to scale the application.
- **Optimized Resource Usage:** Ensure efficient utilization of resources to support scalability.

## Consistency with Coding Standards

- **Adherence to Coding Guidelines:** Follow established coding standards and best practices for the programming language or framework used.
