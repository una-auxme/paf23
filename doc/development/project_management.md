# Project management

(Kept from previous group [paf22])

**Summary:** We use a [Github Project](https://github.com/users/ll7/projects/2) for project management.
Any bugs or features requests are managed in Github.

## Create bug or feature requests

Bugs or features can be added [here](https://github.com/ll7/paf22/issues/new/choose) or via the [issue overview](https://github.com/ll7/paf22/issues).

![create issue](../assets/create_issue.png)

By clicking "New issue" in the overview or using the direct link above a wizard guides you to the creation of an issue:

![issue wizard](../assets/issue_wizard.png)

The possibilities are described in the following sections.

### 🐞 Bug

Use this issue type if you encounter a problem which should already work.
If something is not expected to work, but you want to have it, please refer to the Feature section.

#### Example for "Bug"

The documentation says that the vehicle should detect about 90% of the traffic lights.
However, for you it ignores almost all traffic lights.

### 💡 Feature

Use this template if you want a new Feature which is not implemented yet.

#### Example for "Feature"

Currently, the vehicle can't make u-turns.
Implementing the ability to perform u-turns would be a new feature.

### 🚗 Bug in CARLA Simulator

This is a shortcut to directly report an issue in CARLA Simulator which is not an error in this project.

#### Example for "Bug in CARLA Simulator"

CARLA simulator crashes on startup on your machine.

## Create a Pull Request

To create a pull request, go to the [branches overview](https://github.com/ll7/paf22/branches) and select ``New Pull Request`` for the branch you want to create a PR for.

Merge the pull request after the review process is complete and all the feedback from the reviewer has been worked in.

For more information about the review process, see [Review process](./review_guideline.md).

## Merging a Pull Request

The reviewer should always be the person to merge the PR after an approved review.

If the reviewer has anything he/she would like to have changed or clarified, the review should be marked as `Request Changes`.
If there are no uncertainties the reviewer merges the PR. After a revision of the requested changes the reviewer conducts a second review, if he/she is satisfied with the changes, the PR will be merged by him/her.

Long story short, the reviewer who approves the PR should merge. Only approve if there is nothing to change.

## Deadlines for pull requests and reviews

The deadline for submitting a pull request is **Tuesday** before the end of the sprint at **12:15**.

The deadline for submitting a review for a pull request is **Wednesday** before the end of the sprint at **12:15**.
