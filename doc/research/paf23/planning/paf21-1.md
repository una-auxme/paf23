  - [Global Planner](#global-planner)
  - [Local Planner](#local-planner)

## Global Planner

- Reads the XODR-Files (XML) which contains the designated waypoints
- Divides the total path into small segments and assigns weights to it
- Calculates the shortest path with the Dijkstra algorithm

---

## Local Planner

- `Vehicle Controller` for speed control and steering
- `Decision-Making-Component` as finite state machine for speed control and maneuvers
