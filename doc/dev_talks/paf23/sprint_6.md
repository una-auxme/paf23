# Sprint 5

## General ToDo's

- Merge PR
- Fix Cuda Errors [Backlog]
- Minimum Distance Publisher

## Perception

- Merge Lidar and Vision Nodes {Leon}
- Lidar Flickering {Leon}
- Heading Bug Fix {Robert}
  - Transformation to correct Yaw
  - How is the Heading used in the rest of the code
- Kalman Filter tuning {Robert}
  - Heading
  - Position
  - Publishing the data
- Additional cameras
- Traffic Light Detection
  - Detect traffic lights that are outside

## Planning

- Continue publishing ACC Node → Ignore Emergency Break
- Ignore red traffic lights if already in intersection [Backlog]
  - → Test
- Rebuild Planning Directory
- Verify behaviours
  - Build test node
  - Also test in leaderboard if test node works

## Acting

- Test Emergency Breaks
  - Via Testnode
- Steering Tuning, Testing
  - First Pure Pursuit (easier to tune)
  - Then maybe Stanley

## Notes

Perception:

- Limit Lidar data up and down (Z axis)
  - Or merge multiple images
  - Change Lidar Config because of flickering
- Merge Lidar and Vision Nodes
- Vision Node:
  - Instead of yolov8x seg → rtdetr-x so you can see far enough for traffic lights
- Traffic Light Detection:
  - Extension of traffic light detection classes:
    - Backside, Green, Yellow, Red, Side
  - Publisher:
    - Traffic_light_state
    - Four states:
      - 3 Colors + Unknown
  - Red traffic lights are detected from the wrong side when turning
    - → Planning has to work with this case
- Tuned Kalman filter is amazing!!!
  - Is published as kalman_pos
  - Should replace current_pos
- Heading Bug
  - Dirty fix
  - KalmannHeading is running
- Kalman filter is as accurate as the old filter
- YAAAAAAAAAAAAWWWW!
- We now have a filter for the Heading, which we didn't have before

Planning:

- At np.inf from collision check → no Collision
- Fully integrate ACC and collision check + testing
- Probably some adjustments
- Remove ACC in consultation with Acting
- ACC node should continue to publish messages even if full braking is present
- Build speed calculation not linear
  - → Brake harder the closer
- Maybe ACC with target acceleration instead of target speed
- ACC PID controller has been removed
- Local Planning:
  - Cleaned
  - Rebuild Planning Directory
  - Verify behaviours
    - Build test node
    - Also test in leaderboard if test node works

Acting:

- Velocity_Controller
  - Apply Integral Clipping only at higher or lower values

Misc:

- Extra msg folder that needs to be compiled first
  - → Then every package can recognize the messages
- Carla_Manual_Control → agent_manual.launch
  - Press P key
- Memory Leak:
  - Swap-File in Linux as workaround (approx. 10 GB per minute)
  - Limitation of RAM for the simulator
