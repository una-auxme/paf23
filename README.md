# Praktikum Autonomes Fahren - PAF

This repository contains the source code for the "Praktikum Autonomes Fahren" at the Chair of Mechatronics from the University of Augsburg.
The goal of the project is to develop a self-driving car that can navigate through a simulated environment.
The project is based on the [CARLA simulator](https://carla.org/) and uses the [ROS](https://www.ros.org/) framework for communication between the different components.
In the future, the project aims to contribute to the [CARLA Autonomous Driving Challenge](https://leaderboard.carla.org/challenge/).
The current maintainers of the project are @JulianTrommer and @ll7.

## Prerequisites

To be able to execute and develop the project, you need a Linux system equipped with:

- NVIDIA GPU (everything >= RTX 3070 should be fine)
- A minimum of 16G of RAM - A minimum of 100G of free disk space

As the project is still in early development, these requirements are subject to change.

## Getting started

### Installation

To run the project you have to install [docker](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/) with NVIDIA GPU support,
[nvidia-docker](https://docs.nvidia.com/datacenter/cloud-native/container-toolkit/install-guide.html#docker).
`docker` and `nvidia-docker` are used to run the project in a containerized environment with GPU support.

More detailed instructions about the setup can be found [here](./doc/general/installation.md).

## Development

To get an overview of the current architecture of the agent you can look at the general documentation [here](./doc/general/architecture.md). The individual components are explained in the README files of their subfolders.

If you contribute to this project please read the guidelines first. They can be found [here](./doc/development/README.md).

## Research

The research on existing projects we did can be found [here](./doc/research/README.md).
