Rule-based planning

Advantages:

- Simple implementation.
- Low computational
power.
- Real-time operation.
- Adapt the rationality of
human thinking.
- Its behavior can be easily
traced and explained

Disadvantages:

- Inability to handle
complex environments.
- Risk of rules explosion.
- Inability to handle
uncertainty.
- Low ability to handle
unplanned situations

- Two-layer rule-based theory
- Behaviours: Emergency-Stop, Stop, Yield, Decelerate-To-Halt, Pass-Obstacle, Follow-
Leader, Track-Speed

- simple simulation
- Car only drives straight

## New Architecture for first milestone

- Keeping it simple
- Iterative Progress
- Divide decisions into high level and low level to keep behaviour tree small.

High Level Decisions:

- Intersection
- Lane Change
- Cruise (NoOp)
- (Overtake - limit for multilane)

Low Level Decision:

- Emergency Brake
- ACC

Scenarios:

![Intersection](../../../assets/planning/intersection_scenario.png)

Left: Behaviour Intersection is triggered for motion planning, acc publishes speed. -> Lower speed is used to approach intersection

Right: Behaviour Intersection is used for motion planning, acc is ignored (no object in front)

![Overtake](../../../assets/planning/overtaking_scenario.png)

Left: Overtake gets triggered to maintain speed, acc is ignored

Right: Overtake not possible, acc reduces speed to avoid collision

What needs to be done:

- Implement ACC
- Implement motion planning
- Change publishers in behaviours (only publish name of task)
