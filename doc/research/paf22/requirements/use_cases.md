### Basic flow

1. Sense obstacle in planned driving path of agent
2. Decelerate or brake to avoid collision with obstacle

### Pre-condition(Event)

Obstacle in planned driving path

### Driving functions

- Sense obstacle in driving path
- Decelerate
- Emergency-/Brake

### Outcome

Slow down without crashing into the obstacle in our path

### Associated use cases

[2. Unprotected left turn at intersection with oncoming traffic](#2-unprotected-left-turn-at-intersection-with-oncoming-traffic)

[3. Right turn at an intersection with crossing traffic](#3-right-turn-at-an-intersection-with-crossing-traffic)

[4. Crossing negotiation at unsignalized intersection](#4-crossing-negotiation-at-unsignalized-intersection)

[5. Crossing traffic running a red light at intersection](#5-crossing-traffic-running-a-red-light-at-intersection)

## 19. Parking Cut-in

![img](../../assets/TR12.png)

### Description

The ego-vehicle must slow down or brake to allow a parked vehicle exiting a parallel parking bay to cut in front.

### Basic flow

1. Sense parked car planning to join lane of agent
2. Decelerate or brake to avoid collision with vehicle

### Pre-condition(Event)

Parked car tries to join traffic

### Driving functions

- Sense parked car starts moving
- Decelerate
- Emergency-/Brake

### Outcome

Slow down without crashing into the car joining our lane

### Associated use cases

## 20. Lane changing to evade slow leading vehicle

![img](../../assets/TR05.png)

### Description

The ego-vehicle performs a lane changing to evade a leading vehicle that is moving too slowly.

### Basic flow

1. Sense car speed in front of us
2. Check if car speed is too low
3. Check speed of vehicles in neighbouring lanes
4. If possible change lane
5. Otherwise, wait until lane change is possible and slow down
6. Change lane

### Pre-condition(Event)

Speed of car is under a certain threshold

### Driving functions

- Sense speed of traffic
- Sense vehicles in surrounding lanes
- Decelerate
- Emergency-/Brake
- Change lane

### Outcome

Change lane without any traffic violations

### Associated use cases

[10. Yield to emergency vehicle](#10-yield-to-emergency-vehicle)

[11. Obstacle in lane](#11-obstacle-in-lane)

[13. Slow moving hazard at lane edge](#13-slow-moving-hazard-at-lane-edge)

## 21. Passing obstacle with oncoming traffic

![img](../../assets/TR06.png)

### Description

The ego-vehicle must go around a blocking object using the opposite lane, yielding to oncoming traffic.

### Basic flow

1. Sense obstacle in front of us
2. Check distance and speed of oncoming traffic
3. If oncoming traffic is far enough away, maneuver around obstacle
4. Otherwise, wait until lane change is possible and slow down
5. Maneuver around vehicle

### Pre-condition(Event)

Obstacle in front of us with oncoming traffic

### Driving functions

- Sense obstacle
- Sense length of obstacle
- Sense speed, distance of oncoming traffic
- Sense vehicles in surrounding lanes
- Decelerate
- Brake
- Change lane
- Rejoin old lane after the obstacle

### Outcome

Maneuver around obstacle without any traffic violations

### Associated use cases

[2. Unprotected left turn at intersection with oncoming traffic](#2-unprotected-left-turn-at-intersection-with-oncoming-traffic)

## 22. Parking Exit

![img](../../assets/TR11.png)

### Description

The ego-vehicle must exit a parallel parking bay into a flow of traffic.

### Basic flow

1. Check distance and speed of traffic
2. If traffic is far enough away, join traffic
3. Otherwise, wait until lane is free
4. Join traffic

### Pre-condition(Event)

Ego-vehicle is parked and wants to join traffic

### Driving functions

- Sense space of parking bay
- Sense speed, distance of traffic
- Sense vehicles in lane the agent wants to join
- Accelerate
- Change lane(Join traffic)

### Outcome

Join traffic without any traffic violations

### Associated use cases

[6. Highway merge from on-ramp](#6-highway-merge-from-on-ramp)

[9. Highway exit](#9-highway-exit)

[20. Lane changing to evade slow leading vehicle](#20-lane-changing-to-evade-slow-leading-vehicle)
