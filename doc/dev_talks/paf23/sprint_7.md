# Sprint 7

Next presentation in 6 weeks!

Merge and review during the sprint!

## General ToDo's

- Fix CI or merge without fix

## Perception

- Maybe use the position of the center of the bounding boxes as the position of the objects
- Recognize fire truck
- Fix Vision Node delay on Leaderboard
  - (Vision node looks different on the leaderboard than in Dev Launch)
- (Kalman Filter Bug)
- Fix Lidar error logs!
  - Logs are spammed :(
- Add axis position?
- Traffic Light → where do you have to stop to still see the traffic light

## Planning

- Integration with new Perception features
- More testing / tuning
- If the object to be overtaken is longer than expected
  - if lateral detection is available
  - plan new trajectory
- (Merge Overtaking)
- Maybe make Lane Change "Sloppy"
  - Maybe make the curve for lane changing flatter
- At intersection 2 wait until fire truck passes so the rest can be showcased
- Filter out which cars are on which lane
  - (Are class 2 cars?)

## Acting

- (Clean up Acting)
- (Write proper documentation)
- For Stanley → throw out
- Tune PurePursuit for higher speeds
- Add axis position (towards Heading)

## Notes

Perception

- Next Steps:
  - Also pass Lidar "Heading"
  - Calculate distance to traffic lights
  - Vision Node is heavily delayed on Julius Branch
    - Traffic light detection is also delayed
    - → IMPORTANT
  - Kalman Filter Bug

Planning

- Overtaking:
  - NICE
- Curve speed:
  - Maybe theoretically solve with curve curvature
  - NICE!
- Maybe make Lane Change "Sloppy"
  - Maybe make the curve for lane changing flatter
- Next Steps:
  - Integration with new Perception features
  - More testing / tuning
  - If the object to be overtaken is longer than expected
  - Plan new trajectory
  - Merge Overtaking

Acting

- Stanley
  - Correctly implemented
  - Does not work better than the PurePursuit
  - Maybe not implement PurePursuit linearly
  - Throw out Steering PID
- Next Steps:
  - Clean up Acting
  - Write proper documentation
  - For Stanley → Calculate front axle position
  - For PurePursuit → Calculate rear axle position

Misc

- Performance improvement
  - 40 hz
  - More CPU performance
- New dev launch possibility
  - Autopilot of the NPC vehicles
  - Change of the Spectator perspective
  - Configurable start position
- CI optimizations
  - Less log spam
  - Update of the Simulator Image to Leaderboard 2.0
- NICE
- Next Steps:
  - Expand Dev Route
  - Revise milestones
