# Sprint 4

## General ToDo's

- Fix Submission {Samuel, Max}

## Perception

- LIDAR {Leon}
  - Calculate distance to each detected object
    - Define exactly to which point the distance is calculated
  - Reference coordinate system (maybe at the bumper)
- Get CUDA running {Leon}
- Traffic Light Node {Max}
  - Create new publisher
  - Detect orientation of the traffic light
    - Check relevance
- Complete and test Kalman Filter {Robert}
  - Position
  - Heading
- Document research on other filtering options if not accurate enough {Robert}
  - Maybe Monte Carlo
  - Maybe also implement directly

## Planning

- Collision Check needs to be converted into a node
- Motion planning missing
- Implement ACC
- Change publishers (only publish name of task)

## Acting

- Velocity Controller {Alex}
  - Different step responses
  - Follow-up control
  - Braking
  - Approx. 1 m/s as maximum deviation
- Steering {Alex, Robert}
  - Check implementation
  - PP Waypoint/ Trajectory Vector
- Check Emergency Brake [BACKLOG] {Robert}
