## General Introduction to the Vehicle Controller Component

The [Vehicle Controller](../../code/acting/src/acting/vehicle_controller.py) collects all information from the other controllers in Acting ```throttle```, ```brake```, ```pure_puresuit_steer``` and ```stanley_steer```
to fill them into the CARLA-Vehicle Command Message ```vehicle_control_cmd``` and send this to the CARLA simulator.

It also reacts to some special case - Messages from Planning, such as emergency-braking or executing the unstuck-routine.

## Vehicle Controller Output

As the ```vehicle_control_cmd```-Message requires all 4 Inputs to be in the range of 0 to 1, the Vehicle Controller has to convert both steering signals ```pure_puresuit_steer``` and ```stanley_steer``` from Radians to [0,1].

The ```throttle``` and ```brake``` are already calculated in the correct range by the PID Controller of the Velocity Controller.

This output (vehicle command) has to be sent in the same frequency the leaderboard is expecting them, which currently is about ```20 Hz``` (every 0.05 seconds).

If it we send these commands in a lower frequency the leaderboard keeps waiting for an output, which leads to massive lags!

## Emergency Brake

The Vehicle Controller also reacts to ```emergency```-Messages, published by Planning:

Once the ```emergency_sub``` receives an emergency message from ```paf/hero/emergency```, the ```__emergency``` attribute gets set to either True or stays False.

In case the ```__emergency``` attribute is set to True, the main loop of the vehicle controller ignores any other vehicle command and goes straight into the ```__emergency_brake``` method until the emergency is resolved.

If an emergency is triggered the ```__emergency_brake``` method uses a little braking bug abuse, sending the following vehicle command:

```Python
    message.throttle = 1
    message.steer = 1
    message.brake = 1
    message.reverse = True
    message.hand_brake = True
    message.manual_gear_shift = False
```

The ```__emergency``` attribute can ONLY be set back to False by the ```__get_velocity```, once the car came to a full stop (v < 0.1).

This is done to prevent firing the emergency brake each time the main loop is refreshing.

_Please be aware, that this bug abuse might not work in newer updates!_

## Unstuck Routine

The Vehicle Controller also reads ```current_behavior```-Messages, published by Planning, currently reacting to the **unstuck-behavior**:

This is done to drive in a specific way whenever we get into a stuck situation and the [Unstuck Behavior](/doc/planning/Behavior_detailed.md) is persued.

Inside the Unstuck Behavior we want drive backwards without steering, which is why it is the only case, where we do not use any of our steering controllers.

It's also important to note, that we always receive a target_speed of -3 when in the unstuck routine. Also the __reverse attribute is True in this case.

This is the only case we can drive backwards for now. When implementing an exhausting backwards driving approach this has to be kept in mind, because we DO NOT try to drive at the speed of -3 m/s. We only use the -3 as a keyword for driving backwards at full throttle for a specefic amount of time!

and [maneuvers.py](/code/planning/src/behavior_agent/behaviours/maneuvers.py))
