## Prioritized driving aspects

There are different ways to prioritize the driving aspects mentioned in the document [use_cases](https://github.com/ll7/paf22/blob/482c1f5a201b52276d7b77cf402009bd99c93317/doc/research/use_cases.md).
The most important topics, in relation to this project, are the driving score and the safety aspect.
Also, it is appropriate to implement the basic features of an autonomous car first. The list is a mixture of the different approaches. Prioritizing from very important functionalities to less important features.

`Very important:`

- Recognize the street limitations
- Recognize pedestrians
- Follow the waypoints
- Recognize traffic lights
- Recognize obstacles
- Recognize cars in front of the agent (keep distance)
- Steering, accelerate, decelerate
- Street rules (no street signs available)
- Change lane (obstacles)

`Important:`

- Check Intersection
- Sense traffic (speed and trajectory)
- Predict traffic
- Emergency brake
- Sense length of ramp
- Recognize space (Turn into highway)
- Change lane (safe)
- Recognize emergency vehicle
- Recognize unexpected dynamic situations (opening door, bycicles,...)

`Less important:`

- Smooth driving (accelerate, decelerate, stop)
- Weather Condition
- Predict pedestrians
